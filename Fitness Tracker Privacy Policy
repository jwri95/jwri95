Welcome to the BMI Calculator app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by James Wright, available on Google Play.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
However, data about profile and fitness data is stored on the local device but not shared with either me or a third party.
This data is just stored on your device so it can be used to track your fitness progress, calculate BMI, etc.

As this app is targetted towards users of any age, I have made sure that any content that could be seen by children is appropriate for them.
I have only programmed this app to display ads that are from Google Play certified ad networks, or my own apps that are child appropriate. 
This app complies with all applicable laws and regulations relating to children, such as the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR.

Yours sincerely,
James Wright
