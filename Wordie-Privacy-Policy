Welcome to the Wordie app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by James Wright, available on Google Play.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences, settings, scores) created by the user are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

As this app is targetted towards users of any age, I have made sure that any content that could be seen by children is appropriate for them.
I have only programmed this app to display ads that are from Google Play certified ad networks, or my own apps that are child appropriate. 
This app complies with all applicable laws and regulations relating to children, such as the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
James Wright
